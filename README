Adds Dojo Base as a Javascript Provider for Grails. This provides full support for
<g:formRemote>, <g:remoteField>, <g:remoteFunction>, <g:remoteLink> and <g:submitToRemote>.

Also adds two dojo tags: <dojo:paginate> and <dojo:sortableColumn>. These do the same thing
that the grails versions of the tags but will do them via ajax calls.
